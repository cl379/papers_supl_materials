Supplementary materials and raw data for published papers

These repositories contain suplementary materials, raw data and R codes (if it applies), for various published papers. Each paper is defined by the first author surname, the year of paper submission (please be aware that this can be different from the final publication's year) and a descriptive.

Most commonly the repository will contain any code used for analysis and any tables of raw data used to write the paper. However any other type of suplementary material can be hosted in the repository.

Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions/doubts or if you find any mistake in the analyses/codes! Constructive criticism is always the way forward.
