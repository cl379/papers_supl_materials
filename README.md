## Supplementary materials and raw data for published papers ##

In this repository you can find folders with supplementary materials, raw data and R codes (if it applies), for various published papers. Each paper is defined by the first author surname, the year of paper submission (please be aware that this can be different from the final publication's year) and a descriptive (normally the Journal abreviation).

Most commonly the repository will contain tables of raw data used in the analyses presented and any code used for statistics. However any other type of supplementary material can be hosted in the repository, including the pre-edit version of the accepted paper for self-archiving (green open access).

Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions/doubts or if you find any mistake in the analyses/codes! Constructive criticism is always the way forward.
