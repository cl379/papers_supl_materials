Supplementary materials for published papers

These repositories contain suplementary materials for various published papers. Each paper is defined by the first author surname, the year of paper submission and a descriptive.
Most commonly teh repository will contain any code used for analysis and any tables of raw data used to write the paper. However any other type of suplementary material can be hosted in the repository.
Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions/doubts or if you find any mistake in the analyses/codes! Constructive criticism is always the way forward.
