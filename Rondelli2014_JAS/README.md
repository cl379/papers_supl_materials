In this repository you will find two files:

1. chem_raw_data.csv > contains the values of the multi-element geochemistry and spot-test analyses.
2. correlations.csv > contains values of Pearson’s correlation between measurements

The data were produced as part of the NoGap project, a joint project of Institución Milà y Fontanals, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (Barcelona, Spain) and Maharaja Sayajirao University Baroda (Vadodara, Gujarat, India) under the direction of Marco Madella and P. Ajithprasad. The project received funding from  the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (HAR2010-16052) and by the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport (Proyectos Arqueológicos en el Exterior). The spot tests were carried out as part of the activities of the ERAAUB research group (SGR2009-01173), in the framework of the project PROFOLANT (PIEF-GA-2009-235863, IEF-MC Actions) and the project LRCWMED (HAR2009-08290).
