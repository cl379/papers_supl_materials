Lancelotti, C., Madella, M., Ajithprasad, P., Petrie, C.A. 2010. Temperature, compression and fragmentation: an experimental analysis to assess the impact of taphonomic processes on charcoal preservation. Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences 2: 307â€“320.

In this repository you will find two files:

1. compression_raw_data.csv > contains the values of the wood and charcoal compression experiments described in the paper. 
2. charring_raw_data.ods> contains values of measurements of volume, weight and density of fresh and charred wood.

The data were produced as part of my PhD research at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, with the collaboration of the Department of Material Sciences and Metallurgy of the University of Cambridge.
